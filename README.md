# Purple Scheme

This is a Scheme written in Javascript, on Node.js. I wrote it to learn (more
about) Scheme.

It has proper tail calls and continuations but not macros (yet). It also lacks
in numerical and list semantics, is rough in its error handling, and probably
misses a lot of features I just haven't thought about. I'm proud of it though.

For now it is just a repl, to try it: clone this repo and run: `rlwrap node
purple.js`.
